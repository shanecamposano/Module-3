# Module 3 : Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a reportorial requirement to complete the Module 3 that demonstrates the ability to collect, work with and clean a data set. It contains the `run_analysis.R` script which:

* Concatenate the training and test sets to create one data set
* Extract summary statistics which is the mean and standard deviation for each of the measurement.
* Use the given Activity names to properly name the indicated activities in the data set.
* Label the data set to be human readable
* Create an independent data set with average of each variable for every activity and subject.

The final output is the `tidydata.txt`.
